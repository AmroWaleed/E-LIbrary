                Stephen Covey</a> 

                discovered that high-achievers were often plagued with a sense of emptiness.<br> 
                In an attempt to understand why, he read several self-improvement, self-help, and popular psychology books written over the past 200 years.<br> 
                It was here that he noticed a stark historical contrast between two types of success.<br><br><br> 

                Before the First World War, success was attributed to ethics of character.<br> 
                This included characteristics such as humility, fidelity, integrity, courage, and justice.<br> 
                However, after the war, there was a shift to what Covey refers to as the “Personality Ethic.”<br> 
                Here, success was attributed as a function of personality, public image, behaviors, and skills.<br> 
                Yet, these were just shallow, quick successes, overlooking the deeper principles of life.<br><br><br>
                Covey argues it’s your character that needs to be cultivated to achieve sustainable success,<br> 
                not your personality. What we are says far more than what we say or do.<br> 
                The “Character Ethic” is based upon a series of principles.<br> 
                Covey claims that these principles are self-evident and endure in most religious,<br> 
                social, and ethical systems. They have universal application.<br> 
                When you value the correct principles, you see reality as it truly is.<br> 
                This is the foundation of his bestselling book,<br> 
                <b>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</b>.
